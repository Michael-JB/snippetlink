# snippet

[snippet](https://michael-jb.github.io/snippet) is a simple, private way to
share small pieces of code or text. Your text is stored directly in the page
URL hash and nowhere else, so anyone with the link can read the content but it
otherwise does not leave your device. It uses no frameworks or dependencies and
is served statically without tracking code.

I created snippet as a minimalist, code-oriented alternative to
