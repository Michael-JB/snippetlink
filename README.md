# Snippetlink

[snippetlink.com](https://snippetlink.com) lets you share small pieces of text
or code without leaving a digital footprint. Simply enter your content into
the text field, copy the link and share.

## How it works

Unlike traditional pastebin services that store data in a central database,
Snippetlink compresses and embeds your content directly into the URL
in-browser. This means:
  - The Snippetlink servers never see your content.
  - Anyone with the link can read the content.
  - Once a link is lost or deleted, the content is gone forever as there is no
    online backup.
  - The more text you enter, the longer the link will be.

Because the content is inside the link, the information is only as private as
the way you share it. Treat the link as you would the content itself: share it
via a secure channel (like an encrypted chat) to keep your snippet private.

Snippetlink is simple (<100 lines of JavaScript), tiny (<5 kB), uses no
frameworks or dependencies and is served statically without tracking code.
